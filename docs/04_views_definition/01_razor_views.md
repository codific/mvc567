## Razor Views

The platform mvc567 is based on ASP.NET Core MVC so in case you have issues with the Razor syntax you could check the [Microsoft official documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/views/razor?view=aspnetcore-2.2).

To use current provided standard layouts you might use:
* For ordinary controllers views - **BaseLayout** which has following sections:
  * **Head** (required: false)
  * **Vue** (required: false)

* For admin controllers views - **AdminLayout** which has following sections:
  * **Scripts** (required: false)

* For email views - **EmailLayout**

Each layout could be overridden by creating the new one with the same name in the same relative directory. The **Views** directories generated by the CLI have priority than the library views.
